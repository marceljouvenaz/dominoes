# dominoes 

This is a simple test to build a game without a framework. 

# steps
- main class runs game  
- deal tiles  
- select starting tile  
- alternate player  
- select player action  
- alter gameboard  
- _check whether game has ended_  
- create output  
- go back to alternate player  

# programming steps  
- create main class (class gameplay in game.php)  
- pseudo code the game (as in _steps_)  
- create functions to handle (or delegate) pieces of game logic  
- refactor into classes with formal data definition  

# if there is some time left:  
- do it the other way round. 
- start with lowest level functions and build from there.  
- this allows for tdd.
